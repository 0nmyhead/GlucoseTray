# GlucoseTray
Tray Icon for displaying current BG information in taskbar.

Update the config file with your nightscout url and run the application.  Ensure you go into your taskbar icon settings and ensure it's set to always display the GlucoseTray app.

Always verify the time of the last reading by hovering over the tray icon or clicking it.  Should it crash, the icon may stay in the taskbar but stop updating.

Always check with your DexCom reader before making any treatment decisions.
